    "__üß™ Why Green Solvents ?__<br>\n",
    "Molecule synthesis is a fundamental aspect of chemistry, playing a particularly central role in organic chemistry. However, alongside the valuable compounds produced, chemical processes often generate significant amounts of waste. Among the various contributors to this waste, solvents play a particularly important role. They are widely used to dissolve reagents, regulate reaction temperatures, and assist in purification steps. Unfortunately, many of these solvents are volatile, toxic, and difficult to recycle. In fact, solvents can represent up to 90% of the total mass used in a typical chemical process, making their careful selection a critical concern in sustainable chemistry.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of green chemistry was introduced in the 1990s. Green chemistry focuses on designing products and processes that minimize the use and generation of hazardous substances. Beyond reducing environmental impact, it also aims to improve process efficiency, lower operational costs, and enhance safety for both people and the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "__‚ö°Why using RetroGSF ?__ <br>\n",
    "The primary motivation behind this project is to reduce the environmental footprint of chemical synthesis by identifying greener solvent alternatives, provide a user-friendly tool for chemists to integrate sustainability into their workflows and finally promote green chemistry principles in both academic and industrial settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "To support these goals, our package RetroGSF (Retrosynthesis Green Solvents Finder) was developed. This tool identifies possible synthetic pathways for a given target molecule using the retrosynthetic algorithm AiZynthFinder. It then determines the most likely solvent traditionally used for each reaction step and proposes alternative greener solvents based on their impact on human health, environmental safety, and overall sustainability. The aim is to encourage more environmentally responsible decision-making in organic synthesis by offering practical and data-driven alternatives.\n"
