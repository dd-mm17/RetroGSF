    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Molecule synthesis is a fundamental aspect of chemistry, playing a particularly central role in organic chemistry. However, alongside the valuable compounds produced, chemical processes often generate significant amounts of waste. Among the various contributors to this waste, solvents play a particularly important role. They are widely used to dissolve reagents, regulate reaction temperatures, and assist in purification steps. Unfortunately, many of these solvents are volatile, toxic, and difficult to recycle. In fact, solvents can represent up to 90% of the total mass used in a typical chemical process, making their careful selection a critical concern in sustainable chemistry.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of green chemistry was introduced in the 1990s. Green chemistry focuses on designing products and processes that minimize the use and generation of hazardous substances. Beyond reducing environmental impact, it also aims to improve process efficiency, lower operational costs, and enhance safety for both people and the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary motivation behind this project is to reduce the environmental footprint of chemical synthesis by identifying greener solvent alternatives, provide a user-friendly tool for chemists to integrate sustainability into their workflows and finally promote green chemistry principles in both academic and industrial settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "To support these goals, our package RetroGSF (Retrosynthesis Green Solvents Finder) was developed. This tool identifies possible synthetic pathways for a given target molecule using the retrosynthetic algorithm AiZynthFinder. It then determines the most likely solvent traditionally used for each reaction step and proposes alternative greener solvents based on their impact on human health, environmental safety, and overall sustainability. The aim is to encourage more environmentally responsible decision-making in organic synthesis by offering practical and data-driven alternatives.\n",

    "# Limitations and improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lack of Reaction-Solvent Database:**  \n",
    "   We were unable to find a complete database that directly links reaction SMILES to the solvents typically used for those reactions. As a result, we relied on AI (Gemini) to predict suitable solvents. While this approach is flexible, it is also time- and energy-consuming, and the quality of the suggestions depends on the AI model's training and context.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ranking Criteria Subjectivity:**  \n",
    "   The ranking of alternative solvents is based on physical properties (density, dielectric constant, dipole moment, refractive index) with weights that we subjectively assigned. These weights may not reflect the true importance of each property for all reactions, and the ranking may not always align with practical or industrial preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Limited Scope of Reaction Types:**  \n",
    "   The retrosynthesis and solvent prediction are limited to reaction types and templates covered by the AiZynthFinder and the USPTO-50K dataset. Uncommon or novel reactions may not be well supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User Expertise Required:**  \n",
    "   Effective use of the tool still requires users to have some background in chemistry, especially to interpret the results and make final decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Develop or Integrate a Reaction-Solvent Database:**  \n",
    "   Building or integrating a complete database that links reaction SMILES or classes to commonly used solvents would improve accuracy and reduce reliance on AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Refine Ranking Methodology:**  \n",
    "   The ranking system could be improved by incorporating feedback from chemists, using machine learning to optimize weights, or including additional criteria such as cost, availability, or regulatory status.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User Customization:**  \n",
    "   Allowing users to adjust the weights for ranking criteria or to input their own constraints would make the tool more flexible and relevant to specific needs.\n"
